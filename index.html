<p>Hi <strong><u>Hayato</u></strong>. I am making web browser and I want to share with you. I need to practice to use what I know since yesterday. I feel good when I am studying this, I think this is because I feel this techology is attractive and lots of possiblities to be greater in future. I or we eventually will need this and people expect it could be deveploped a lot in someday. I want to be part of it. It is like I don't need to be a successfull engineer just be the person who understand what this invisible techonolgy is.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel I eventually do learn Enlgish for this, because all these technologies are made of English language. So I really need to know English first to get close to know well this. So I am kinda glad that I know how to read English especially when I should search some information through the web browser such as Google. I tried to search same thing in Korean with Naver - the green one I've been always used but the results are not as much as that I can find through Google web site in English.  </p>
<p>This technoloty is Europian's idea, I think I have blood of them to see the world or myself. This people are trying to be logical and neat when they do sth even to see the world. However asian value is not like that, I think the value of asia is also brilliant yet I can't understand either. They are too emotional with everything. (I mean especially my people from South Korea) I don't really agree with the way of  progress in asia, that sometimes make me sick - such as not logical customs but people must obey it.</p>

<p>See you in next page!</p>
