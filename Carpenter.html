<h4>3.Germary</h4>

<p>Less than plumbers, carpenters in Germany can earn an average annual wage of: €29,976 (£26,359).</p>

Education
<p>If you wish to become a carpenter in Germany, then you’ll need to complete a registration with the Register of Crafts and Trades to become self-employed in carpentry. If you have equivalent qualifications that are seen as acceptable, such as an apprenticeship – then your registration may be granted subject to circumstances and skill level. </p>


<h4>4.Japan</h4>
<p>A carpenter in Japan can earn an average wage of ¥3,940,000 (£27,854).</p>
Education
<p>Knowledge regarding Japanese carpentry is usually passed on through one to one apprenticeship training. Usually, the apprentice seeks out training, and begins by performing menial tasks in the workshop. Once the carpenter is satisfied with the jobs that have been completed, formal training begins with rudimentary tools and basic instruction. After this, 50% of apprentices move on to complete a degree. </p>

By Region
<p>In the following cities, a carpenter’s wage can change drastically if the carpenter is a supervisor; carpenter supervisors in Yokohama can earn the most money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo: ¥10,962,608 (£77,482);</li>
<li>Fukuyama: ¥6,877,875 (£48,611);</li>
<li>Yokohama: ¥9,484,838 (£67,037);</li>
<li>Hiroshima: ¥7,377,485 (£52,143).</li>
</ul>

<p>In Japan, it’s clear that electricians who are qualified to degree level, and have many years of experience in supervising a team, can earn a significantly higher annual wage than those working in plumbing and carpentry industries. However, carpenter supervisors based in Tokyo can still earn more than plumbers who are stationed in Tokyo. </p>
