<h4>3.Northern Territory (NT)</h4>

<p>Darwin - Home of the Australian Outback</p>
<p>Australia's Northern Territory extends from the tropical waters of the Arafura Sea in the north to the Simpson Desert in Central Australia, covering one-sixth of the country's land-mass. With a population of almost 212 000 (last Census 2011), the Northern Territory has a clean environment, pristine oceans and friendly communities. It combines a relaxed lifestyle with an economic climate that is ideal for investment and business development.<p>
<p>The Northern Territory is closer to Asia than to the centres of southern Australia, making it Australia's Asian Gateway. It has a progressive, development-oriented government and offers a range of business and investment opportunities. The capital city, Darwin, is modern and sophisticated with a vibrant, multicultural population and long-standing cultural and trading links in the Asia Pacific region.</p>

<strong><p>NT has lots of chances as here is developing area. However the horrible hot weather and many dangerous animals living there such as crocodiles. Also nost of Aborigine live here to beg money or do crimes. So the quaility of life will be lower than others I guess. </p></strong>
